# AMD Testing Improvements

## Overview

This document details the improvements made to the Answering Machine Detection (AMD) testing suite for the Elevenlabs-Twilio AI Caller system. The enhancements address several gaps in the existing test coverage and ensure comprehensive verification of the system's ability to handle all possible answering scenarios.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Complete AMD Result Type Coverage

The enhanced test suite now covers all possible Twilio AMD response types:

- Human detection
- Machine detection with various subtypes:
  - `machine_start`
  - `machine_end_beep`
  - `machine_end_silence`
  - `machine_end_other`
- Fax machine detection
- Unknown/uncertain detection

### 2. SIP Response Code Handling

Comprehensive testing for various SIP response codes:

- 200 OK (successful call)
- 486 Busy
- 480 Temporarily Unavailable

### 3. Edge Case Testing

New tests for scenarios that were previously untested:

- Voicemail detection when sales team is already connected
- Human detection that changes to voicemail mid-call

### 4. Direct Callback Simulation

Enhanced testing approach that directly simulates Twilio callbacks:

- Direct status callback simulation without relying on Twilio client
- Direct AMD callback simulation for improved test reliability

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses Jest's mocking capabilities to simulate Twilio responses and callbacks. Key changes include:

1. Using the actual `callStatuses` object from the main module instead of creating a separate test-only version
2. Properly capturing and executing route handlers for both AMD callbacks and status callbacks
3. Ensuring that the mock Fastify instance correctly processes the registered routes
4. Verifying that the system correctly identifies and processes all types of answering machine scenarios

## Future Considerations

As Twilio's AMD capabilities evolve, this test suite provides a solid foundation that can be extended to account for:

1. New AMD result types that Twilio may introduce
2. Additional edge cases in call handling
3. Enhanced retry logic for different types of failed calls

These tests significantly improve the reliability of the voicemail detection system and ensure that the AI caller correctly handles all possible scenarios when contacting leads.
