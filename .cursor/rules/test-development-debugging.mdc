# Test Driven Approach
- When the user asks for a new feature or update, ensure we have written a Comprehensive test suite and also ensure that you follow a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.
- After the conclusion of a feature, ensure you update the readme file to keep the project current.

# Test Debugging
- If tests fail, ensure that we don't just patch up the test to pass it but are ignoring a potential issue in the actual code itself. This is counterproductive to what we need to do.
