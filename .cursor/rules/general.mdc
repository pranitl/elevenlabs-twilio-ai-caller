# Feature Request Clarification and Requirements Translation
- When the user asks for a new feature or update, clarify the user's overall intent of the feature before doing anything and ask clarifying questions. The user will generally provide the business directive and your job is to translate that to a plan for implementation but you need to fully understand the ask frist.
